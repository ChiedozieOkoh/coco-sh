# Coco-sh

Coco-sh is a simple linux shell implementation written in C. I plan to make it a fully posix compliant login shell but for now that is a distant development goal.

**Build Instructions** 

you will need gnu make and gcc installed to build the project. 

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Create a folder called bin in the root of the repository.
3. Run the command `make` . 
4. The built executable should be in the *bin* folder under the name *coconut*
